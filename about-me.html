    <h2><Strong>Why I am attending Epicodus</Strong></h2>
    <p><em>Up to this point in my life I have spent years in school studying Computer Science but I ended up hitting a wall. That wall
      is how much it cost for me to complete my remaining 2 years at PSU. I believe me paying the upfront cost for Epicodus would be 
      significantly cheaper than paying tuition to finish my Computer Science degree. With the part-time program, I am also able to 
      work my day job and still have time to attend the bootcamp.
